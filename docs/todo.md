To Do
===============================================================================
Not only is this a massive project, but it's failry complex. Below is a rough to do list to help keep us on track. Unless they are numbered, they don't need to be completed in any specific order.

* Theme Options Page
	* Site Builder
		* Core template files, stored in /templates/core, refer to header.php, searchform.php, etc
		* Installed refer to templates that where installed and updatable
		* Custom are not updatable
		* Drop downs for all available files (Core, Installed, Custom)
		* Draggable items. Core files are parents, installed and custom are children. Only 1 child deep
		* Order of the itmes equate the to the order of load
	* Preview Button
		* Preview the site with the current build
	* Colors, Fonts, background images, etc
