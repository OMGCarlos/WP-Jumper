[WP Jumper](http://strapmywp.com)
===============================================================================
A hot swappable responsive starter kit for WordPress designed to jumpstart your next project and keep it fresh. Forever.

The idea is simple, kinda - create a set of tools which makes mixing and matching templates possible. A set of tools which lets ***you*** preview templates on your own site without affecting what everyone else sees. A set of tools which makes web development even faster...and let's *anyone* do it regardless of skill (or complete lack of).

Then, on top of all that, design it so that it is always up-to-date. <i>Always</i>.

WP Jumper lets you do all this, and to borrow from [Pedro's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEJFWoAVJz4) epic words of promise...it will make all your wildest development dreams come true! Completely free and open sourced, of course &hearts;
